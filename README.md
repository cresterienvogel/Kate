# Kate
Powerful and elegant Garry's mod Administration System

# Menu
There are no menus due to the instinctively named commands.<br>
If the menu is an important part for you, consider using the "old" branch.

# Aliases
Keep in mind that there are aliases here, so you can literally write !tp or !tele instead of !teleport.<br>
Aliases have been added to almost every command, so you can write commands on instinct and in most cases they will run.
